# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature improves the accessibility permission onboarding experience by replacing the current complex permission window with a simplified flow. The new experience guides users through enabling accessibility permissions with clear instructions and a direct system settings integration, automatically transitioning to the main application once permissions are granted.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user launching the app for the first time, I want a simple and clear explanation of why accessibility permissions are needed, so that I understand the purpose and feel confident granting them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches AND accessibility permissions are not granted THEN the system SHALL display a simplified permission window
2. WHEN the permission window is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a clear, user-friendly explanation of why accessibility permissions are required
3. WHEN the permission window is displayed THEN the system SHALL include a prominent button to open system settings
4. WHEN the permission window is displayed THEN the system SHALL NOT show complex technical details or overwhelming information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user who needs to grant accessibility permissions, I want a direct way to open the correct system settings page, so that I don't have to navigate through multiple system preference panels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the settings button THEN the system SHALL open the Privacy & Security > Accessibility section of System Preferences/Settings
2. WHEN the system settings open THEN the current application SHALL be visible in the accessibility apps list
3. WHEN the system settings open THEN the user SHALL be able to toggle the accessibility permission for this app
4. IF the system settings cannot be opened programmatically THEN the system SHALL provide clear manual navigation instructions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user who has just enabled accessibility permissions, I want the app to automatically detect this change and proceed to the main interface, so that I don't need to manually restart or navigate back to the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessibility permissions are granted THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the permission change
2. WHEN accessibility permissions are detected as granted THEN the system SHALL immediately transition to the main application screen
3. WHEN transitioning to the main screen THEN the system SHALL close or hide the permission window
4. WHEN accessibility permissions are revoked while the app is running THEN the system SHALL handle this gracefully and return to the permission flow if necessary

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user who may be hesitant about granting system permissions, I want to understand what the app will do with accessibility access, so that I can make an informed decision about granting permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the permission window is displayed THEN the system SHALL include a brief, clear explanation of how accessibility permissions will be used
2. WHEN the permission window is displayed THEN the system SHALL reassure users about privacy and security
3. WHEN the permission window is displayed THEN the system SHALL avoid technical jargon and use user-friendly language
4. IF the user needs more information THEN the system SHALL provide a way to access additional details without cluttering the main interface
